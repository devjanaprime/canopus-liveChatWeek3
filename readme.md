Things to consider
---

- could you use conditionals to make sure the index sent to the ```getMeal``` function is within the appropriate range? That is, don't allow numbers less than zero or greater than or equal to the array length.
- could you create another array (maybe "drinks?")?
- could you modify the functions to receive an argument telling it which array to use?
